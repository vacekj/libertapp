A full security report can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-ecosystem-reserve-v2/tree/release/final-proposal#security), but as summary:\n- Full test coverage via units tests in the Forge environment.\n- Security review from Aave community members.\n- Minimal changes from the Sablier's v1 logic used as base for the streaming capabilities. The original codebase is audited and battle tested (running in production with meaningful funds for a long time).\n- Set of properties (formal verification) by Certora.\n- Slither analysis of the codebase.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- [AaveEcosystemReserveController](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d569673daa0575c936c7c67c4e6aeda69cc630c#code)\n- [AaveEcosystemReserveV2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1aa435ed226014407fa6b889e9d06c02b1a12af3#code)\n- [PayloadAaveBGD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1e12071bd95341aa92fcba1513c714f9f49282a4#code)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).","ipfsHash":"QmW2Mw15fhopJN7Tt9SJc3MHqJ5zPQrnFuPqDrf34TWmW9","originalHash":"0x722e11fe1e1a1cbeb06c64a278d343a2537b5f9f80975cc5f7788e9f402ce852","id":71},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
