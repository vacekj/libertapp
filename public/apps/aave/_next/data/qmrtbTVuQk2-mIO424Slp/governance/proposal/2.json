In the worst-case scenario of critical failure, an amount to be decided will be slashed from stakers deposits.\n\nIn this phase 0 of the slashing, the auction mechanism will not be automatized yet and if a slash were to happen it would be done through governance and direct compensation.\n\n\n## AIP content in short\n\n- Increasing the Safety Incentives: As the possibility of slashing will now be formally introduced, staking reward should reflect the risk. Hence we propose to increase the Safety Incentives to 550 AAVE per day\n- Slashing %: The maximum slashing amount is set to 30%\n\n\n## Implementation details\n\nThe payload to be executed is available at\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4ab8ba929e4cc780cb82be34eea29a9ea7a58049#code\n\nThe payload will upgrade the Aave reserve contract to a new implementation\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xa335e2443b59d11337e9005c9af5bc31f8000714#code\n\nAnd introduce a reserve controller, with the rights of approving transfers/transferring assets out of the Aave Reserve, under control of the Aave governance short executor\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x1e506cbb6721b83b1549fa1558332381ffa61a93#code\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n","ipfsHash":"QmVrTta734LkhPcbAXLDcob6gk9NFwiEpggQRYHZx8Mr16","originalHash":"0x6fa4ffc06b51e51d9d257c0460e1c0e58b81b448d990c354c4c866ae8fe812d9","id":2},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
