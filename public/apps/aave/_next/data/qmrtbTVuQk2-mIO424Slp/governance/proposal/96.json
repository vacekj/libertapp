As a result, FEI will become backed 1:1 with DAI and redeemable 1FEI:1DAI. With Tribe DAO transitioning into a terminal state, the FEI stablecoin will overtime be redeemed for DAI.\n\nAs FEI is redeemed for DAI, over time FEI’s circulating supply and liquidity will fall away. Without sufficient liquidity, liquidations can not be performed efficiently which creates a risk for the Ethereum Aave v2 market.\n\nIn response, this ARC proposes freezing the FEI market which will Disabling Deposits, Disabling Borrowing and increase the Reserve Factor from 20% to 100%. Users will still be able to redeem aFEI and repay debt. \n\n# Motivation\n\nWith the emergence of news that Tribe DAO intends to dissolve FEI and the Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) backing the stablecoin, there is a need to amend the FEI reserve in preparation of the risks to emerge with transition Tribe DAO to a terminal state.\n\nThe details around how Tribe DAO will transition from current state to terminal state can be found [here](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao/4475).\n\nSnapshot found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x19df23070be999efbb7caf6cd35c320eb74dd119bcb15d003dc2e82c2bbd0d94). \n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal will freeze the FEI reserve on the pool, stopping supply of liquidity and borrowing.\n\nBorrowing Enabled → Disable \nDeposits Enabled → Disable \n\nAlso,\n\nReserve Factor 20% → 100%\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThis proposal has been tested and peer reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://twitter.com/bgdlabs).\n\nTest cases can be found: [Here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-risk-param-updates-fei/blob/main/src/test/ValidationFeiRiskParamsUpdate.sol)\n\n## Implementation\n\nDeployment of the proposal payload can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb8fe2a2104afb975240d3d32a7823a01cb74639f#code)\n\nThe repository of the payload can be found [here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-risk-param-updates-fei)\n \nThe proposal calls freezeReserve on the LendingPoolConfigurator (0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756) targeting FEI (0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA).\n\nThe proposal calls the setReserveFactor function on the LendingPoolConfigurator (0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756) for the FEI (0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA) market with the new reserve Factor set to 10000 (100%).\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n","ipfsHash":"QmXRZUjx2nYJvm1Evfjzc8GTFzNkuwGGBx4LLczLKzAgix","originalHash":"0x86fb2c1c7056f55ddfebe82b634419b2170c5cb5b981df6a0d19523dba959575","id":96},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
