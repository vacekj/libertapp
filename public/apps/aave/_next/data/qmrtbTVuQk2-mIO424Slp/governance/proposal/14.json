The following AIP moves forward the end date of the emission for the AAVE and AAVE/ETH Safety module to continue with the safety incentives program estabilished within the Aavenomics framework. The date will be set 100 years in the future, to effectively disable the emission date as control mechanism and allow the safety incentives to be controlled only using the emission per second (if there will be consensus around ending the AAVE safety incentives, it will be controlled by setting the emission per second to 0).\nAs a consequence of how the incentives system work and the duration of this vote (which will require high consensus, 10 days vote and\n7 days timelock) the emission of AAVE incentives will stop on Sunday 9th, but it will restart from where it left if the vote passes (participants of the safety module will not lose any reward as long as they keep staking while the proposal is executed).\n\n## AIP Content in short\n\nExtend the end date of the incentives for the Aave Safety module (stkAAVE and stkABPT) 100 years in the future.\n\n## Relevant links\n\n AIP-7 implementing the last quarter Aavenomics quarterly schedule: https://app.aave.com/governance/2-QmVrTta734LkhPcbAXLDcob6gk9NFwiEpggQRYHZx8Mr16\n* Community-led main Governance thread on the quarterly schedule plan: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-fees-rewards-how-to-improve-the-aave-token-value/830\n* Aavenomics proposal : https://aave.com/aavenomics\n\n\n## Implementation details\n\n[needed]\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n","ipfsHash":"QmTYMox4aBpyQH53LwMzTuJY2z7Df7ANUSakeeeWWUoXmJ","originalHash":"0x4d4a4bda3036f8da3f6911941df8c185f0e4ec248de44b44253dae5a4798a001","id":14},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
