Since then, there has been a near 100% utilization rate of deposited assets.\n\nThe reserveFactor allows the FeeCollector smart contract to receive part of the interest paid by takers of liquidity. Each asset on Aave has its own reserveFactor.\n\nAIP-26 raises the maximum borrowing rate for AMPL and would result in more fees coming into the system. This AIP proposes (in tandem) lowering the AMPL reserve factor from 20% to 10%. This shares more of the revenue with AMPL suppliers to further incentivize deposits.\n\n# Relevant Links\n\n- AIP-12 AMPL Listing: https://app.aave.com/governance/18-QmZZ7JqvEx99u7dMNFPBBnew3BgepLCmXRMrNi8y5ndpXn\n- AIP-26: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-raise-ampl-maximum-interest-rate/4996\n- Aavenomics: https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/\n\n## Implementation\n\ncall setReserveFactor(0xd46ba6d942050d489dbd938a2c909a5d5039a161, 1000)\n\nOn the lending pool configurator contract\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x311bb771e4f8952e6da169b425e7e92d6ac45756\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n","ipfsHash":"QmdfFTxuuu7jQv9se4XFUy3w2RCh35kfp4ocUqr69q1X8W","originalHash":"0xe3a30eb1373b01235923215abf4ae32fbc1dd81e0036a882392c3d6c706147ab","id":24},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
