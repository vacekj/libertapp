Now that the Ethereum Merge has passed, this proposal re-enables ETH borrowing to revert the market back to normal conditions.  \n\n## Motivation\n\nFull details are provided in the original [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-re-enabling-eth-borrowing-post-merge/9657).\n\nGiven the timing of the Merge, this proposal allows for a few days of monitoring post-Merge before this proposal can be executed. Should conditions turn undesirable, voters should vote No, and this proposal should be canceled. \n\n\n## Specification\n\n* The proposal calls `enableBorrowingOnReserve` with the parameters `address` = `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` (WETH address on mainnet) and `stableBorrowRateEnabled` as `true`.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n","ipfsHash":"QmQ9QmhRr8A7agxofKckXVN9CDgGE5tfLdYsAaf64BW8KD","originalHash":"0x1ad639a0fe12d46fdce998b69b9f9d9d13108baf13d35fea601f1017c3723364","id":101},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
