Only one yearly review will be required.\n\n\n# ARC content in short\n\n* With the AIP-18 and this proposal, Safety Incentives are maintained until a change is implemented for the next year.\n\n# Relevant Links\n\n* AIP-19 postponing the end of safety incentives: https://app.aave.com/governance/14-QmTYMox4aBpyQH53LwMzTuJY2z7Df7ANUSakeeeWWUoXmJ\n* Aavenomics : https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/\n\n## Implementations details\n\nexecutes approve(0x4da27a545c0c5B758a6BA100e3a049001de870f5, 200750) and\napprove(0xa1116930326D21fB917d5A27F1E9943A9595fb47, 200750) on the Aave ecosystem reserve 0x25f2226b597e8f9514b3f68f00f494cf4f286491. https://etherscan.io/address/0x4da27a545c0c5B758a6BA100e3a049001de870f5 is the stkAAVE contract and https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326D21fB917d5A27F1E9943A9595fb47 is the stkABPT address.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n","ipfsHash":"QmfYfZhLe5LYpCocm1JxdJ7sajV1QTjrK5UCF1TGe5HTfy","originalHash":"0xffaa9d3c5810d40206e289407e9935e447e1fa4183c672e03fa69486e7d8b41c","id":15},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
