By partially funding the AGD with stablecoins, budgeting will be easier. The aUSDC will be funded through an approval and the AAVE will be funded with a transfer. Our initial proposal was made in May 2021 and our renewal proposal was made in November 2021.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave Grants DAO is a community-led grants program, focused on growing a thriving ecosystem of contributors within Aave through funding ideas, projects and events that benefit the ecosystem. We aim to drive development on top of Aave and ensure a constant influx of talented builders to maintain Aave’s long term growth. We help build culture and community around the Aave ecosystem that in turn attracts the best contributors.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nThe full test of this proposal can be found here: https://github.com/llama-community/renew-aave-grants\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis proposal includes a $3M transfer of AAVE from the AaveEcosystemReserve to the grants DAO multisig and the AaveV2Collector approving $3M of aUSDC to the grants DAO multisig. This will allow the grants DAO to withdraw funds as needed and let the V2Collector to continue to earn interest in the meantime. The proposa payload will target the contract AaveEcosystemReserveController and call the function `function transfer(address collector, IERC20 token, address recipient, uint256 amount)` and `approve(address collector, IERC20 token, address recipient, uint256 amount)`.\n\n**Target Contracts**\n\nProposalPayload = [0x8e7df91fed22c192a3aa1bb6143879295ee91295](\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x8e7df91fed22c192a3aa1bb6143879295ee91295)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n","ipfsHash":"QmQh4kBVdvj6m3eXmxns5ovehwa9bisgWxkz6eGSgRuE7B","originalHash":"0x22f22ad910127d3ca76dc642f94db34397f94ca969485a216b9d82387808cdfa","id":73},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
