FEI’s risk parameters were not updated, and FEI was not enabled as a collateral.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nENJ risk parameters including LTV, liquidation threshold, and liquidation bonus will be reverted to their original values before AIP 55 was executed. FEI will be enabled as collateral and its initial parameters will be an LTV of 50%, a liquidation threshold of 60%, and a liquidation bonus of 6.5%. The below table specifies the changes that this AIP will make.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4qAK6O3.png)\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the LTV, liquidation threshold, and liquidation bonus by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\n[Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/resolving-error-on-parameter-changes/7053).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n","ipfsHash":"Qma1jU4Cdw9QTKYCiaCPtfZX8SEcHpYFknWk1ugiK88rfm","originalHash":"0xad73965c51069578b8399723fff26290f521ec080290a5cf2f22edd3450c7634","id":57},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
