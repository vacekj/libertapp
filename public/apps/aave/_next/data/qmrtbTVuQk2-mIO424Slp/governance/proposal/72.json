This proposal recommends updating the Aave Arc market LTV parameter to match the LiquidationThreshold of the same asset listed on Aave mainnet v2 market. \nWe intend to re-propose a quarterly update of the risk parameters for the Aave Arc market quarterly in an attempt to keep both markets in sync with Aave mainnet v2 market, or Aave mainnet v3 once live.\n# Motivation\nThis risk parameter change is targeting the following improvements on the Aave Arc Market:\nAlign Risk Parameters - The risk parameters on Aave Arc market are currently more conservative and are in need of being updated to better reflect the Aave mainnet v2 market and also the risk profile of the user.\nImprove UX - Increasing LTV ratios and reducing the Liquidity Penalty enables greater capital efficiency across the market. \nGiven the extra precaution shown when approving Borrowers on the Aave Arc Market, the recommendation is to amend the LTV to reflect the risk profiles of market participants. For now, the intent is to maintain the Aave Arc market in line with the mainent v2 market on a quarterly basis.\n# Specification\nThe below table shows the assets listed on the Aave Arc market and their respective risk parameters.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/srP17ZX.png)\n\n\nThe below table shows the assets listed on the Aave Arc market and their respective risk parameters on the Aave v2 market.
