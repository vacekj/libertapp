These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe past two weeks saw slight decreases in volatility. However, there were also decreases in liquidity and trading volume. Our simulations show that increasing borrow parameters across a wide array of assets could introduce significantly more risk in the short term. The below recommendations drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining risk at safe levels.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jq3kdSB.png)\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0UZoeQX.png)\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonus, LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2022-02-24/7385/2).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n","ipfsHash":"QmYpkByYwDNxB6ds36Fi1UuLuMbRwXpEXwoNr3aiQyM9Ck","originalHash":"0x9bc7542875a9e1bf818c791d1d6bcb0f23372939c75601bcaa36be40f342de89","id":64},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
