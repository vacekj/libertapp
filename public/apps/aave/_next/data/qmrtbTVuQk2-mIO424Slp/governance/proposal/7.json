This has generated a consistent amount of stable rate debt, which results in frictions for the V1 liquidity providers and integrators that still rely on Aave V1 for their deposits.\n\nIf this proposal is approved by the Aave governance, new stable rates loans positions will be disabled for Aave V1.\n\nThe rebalancing mechanism will also be updated to an enforced swap to variable rates. Which means, in case of extremely high borrowing pressure on the stablecoins reserves, users at stable rate will be migrated to variable until rebalancing conditions are not satisfied anymore.\n\n\n## AIP content in short\n\nDeactivation of the ability to open new stable rate borrowing positions on Aave V1 and update of the rebalance mechanism\n\n## Implementations details\n\nExecutes the proposal deployed at\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x6a46c03c861cab74c8a213983b7eb295234c16b3#code\n\nThe proposal executes the following:\n\n- Updates the LendingPool implementation to \n\n  https://etherscan.io/address/0xDB9217fad3c1463093fc2801Dd0a22C930850A61#code\n\n- Updates the LendingPoolCore implementation to\n\n  https://etherscan.io/address/0x2847A5D7Ce69790cb40471d454FEB21A0bE1F2e3#code\n\n  These contract updates are needed to update the implementation of the rebalanceStableRate() function\n\n- Execute disableReserveStableBorrowRate() in all the assets listed on the protocol V1\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n","ipfsHash":"QmXwFPhN3ABDzBuEhPTzeXzuQdGkHfWtEZn348LQWxuFFZ","originalHash":"0x8e9625443f5a606408e94696458da7d47efb7cb68015b4c672ffe13372dd6934","id":7},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
