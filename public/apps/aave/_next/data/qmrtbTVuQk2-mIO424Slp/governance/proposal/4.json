In the case of a late or no vote on a new SI allocation plan, the current allocation will continue until a vote or until the ER is empty.\n\n## Implementations details\n\nThe implementation of the AIP consist in three actions: \n- Transfer proxy ownerships of [ABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41a08648c3766f9f9d85598ff102a08f4ef84f84) and [stkABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47) to the Long Timelocked Governance Executor.\n- Configure [stkABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47) to reward stakers for 550 AAVE per day.\n- Approve 550 AAVE per day for 3 months allowance from Reserve for [stkABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47) rewards.\n\nIf this AIP is validated by a community vote, the following addresses will be involved in the execution process :\n\n- [AIP9 Proposal Payload](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd08E12367A7D68CAA8ff080D3A56b2dc6650709b#contracts)\n- [ABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41a08648c3766f9f9d85598ff102a08f4ef84f84)\n- [stkABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa1116930326d21fb917d5a27f1e9943a9595fb47)\n- [Aave Reserve Controller](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1E506cbb6721B83B1549fa1558332381Ffa61A93)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).","ipfsHash":"QmS8SNqXhvHHUuXBhch2iUkRDpRnM2ds9iqeSdgxjSVSmU","originalHash":"0x384dd57abcd23aae459877625228062db4082485a0ac1fc45eb54524f5836507","id":4},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
