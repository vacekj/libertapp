As Aave  continues to make progress on its growth trajectory, it is becoming obvious that certain proposals need to allow more time for pre-vote analysis. For instance, [AIP-33: Add FEI to Aave V2](https://app.aave.com/governance/35-QmbfLFGJdZQn21pwJGQzVnFqLk4vXHTmHUhio8ArWmvVqZ) was, fortunately, able to be canceled, via delegation removal, rather than needing to use the [Aave Guardian](https://medium.com/aave/aave-protocol-governance-v2-has-been-activated-af4a4b228885). \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aCML4k3.png)\n\n\nThis month has seen the most governance proposals (9) of any month since Aave V2 has launched with no sign of slowing given the variety of authors and proposal type.\n## Proposal \nA formal analysis period is defined as a non-voting period where a proposal is active (e.g. submitted on-chain). Currently, the `votingDelay` configured on [Aave governance](https://etherscan.io/address/0xec568fffba86c094cf06b22134b23074dfe2252c#readContract) is set to 0 - voting begins immediately when proposals are created.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/J7ohC0U.png)\n\n\n We propose to set this voting delay to 2 days, in seconds, using the `setVotingDelay` method on the core governance contract. Setting the `votingDelay` will cause there to be a new review period between the proposal submission and when voting for that proposal begins. \n\n## Potential Side Effects \n- The Guardian is marginally more likely to be needed should time sensitive issues arise.\n- Gauntlet’s risk parameterization will see a delay from time to identifying a suboptimal risk parameter to executing a change. At least until a `riskAdmin` role is implemented. \n\n## Implementation \n\nWe set the voting delay using `setVotingDelay` on the core governance contract located at `0xEC568fffba86c094cf06b22134B23074DFE2252c`, with a delay of `172800` seconds, or 2 days.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).","ipfsHash":"QmRRPxRBpQuU7iZZPbFZfBQ6gg5LNqG2XAgfuWiiK76Xuj","originalHash":"0x2dca488413a88dd1e196313709928b627a5a0d6b4ba91a250ed680cd83ce4052","id":41},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
