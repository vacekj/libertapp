These paramater updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations, the latest being [AIP-42: Risk Parameter Updates 2021-10-14](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/42-Qmd8PTDdcq971N6QhLAKBdxN3sjdV5KJqqVw45CaRGRnej).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. For more detail on Gauntlet's first two months of recommendations and their impact, please see our [Monthly Risk Report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-updates-and-review-october-2021/5887).\n\n\n## Specification\n\nNo significant changes in volatility or liquidity were observed in most assets. However, we would note that the collateral usage of ZRX on Aave almost doubled, so that is an asset that we are monitoring during the upcoming period.\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| ENJ Liquidation Threshold    | 65%     | 70%     |\n| DPI Loan To Value     | 55%     | 65%     |\n| DPI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |\n| ZRX Loan To Value     | 65%     | **60%**     |\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 10/14 to 10/21 that were important drivers for the updated parameter recommendations.\n\n|Symbol| 10-21 Volatility| 10-14 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |\n|------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|\n|DPI   |0.924661802    |1.07082198     |-0.146160178     |96.2012726|\n|ENJ   |1.099162375    |1.165823176    |-0.518381803     |40.9981913|\n|ZRX   |1.067526026   |1.230865683   |-0.163339657    |-34.0377076 |\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ClTTce2.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Implementation \n\nThe proposal sets the LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2021-10-21/5929/8?).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n","ipfsHash":"QmZb3yBeYJv1ruGWfY1h7XNcya82Q6Jqs4Q7b5dDMwuN3U","originalHash":"0xa720fcd5e70ada773670bca03bc9a5474dcb2fc08a38796efd5fac92aaef7383","id":43},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
