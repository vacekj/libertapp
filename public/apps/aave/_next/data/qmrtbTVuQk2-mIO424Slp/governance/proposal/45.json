In addition, we propose freezing the KNCL reserve. \n\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations, the latest being [AIP-43: Risk Parameter Updates 2021-10-21](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/43-QmZb3yBeYJv1ruGWfY1h7XNcya82Q6Jqs4Q7b5dDMwuN3U).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. For more detail on Gauntlet's first two months of recommendations and their impact, please see [Q2 Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-q2-dynamic-risk-parameters/5955) and the [Monthly Risk Report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-updates-and-review-october-2021/5887).\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis past week had significant updates in market conditions as well as drastic changes within the Aave protocol. Volatility drops and increases in trading volume and liquidity for most assets were observed. At the same time, there were significant withdrawals from stablecoins reserves. These transactions should not lead to less protocol safety, but these transient changes are important to consider within the context of ecosystem structure.\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 7.5%     |\n| REN Loan To Value     | 55%     | 60%     |\n| REN Liquidation Threshold     | 60%     | 65%     |\n| SNX Loan To Value    | 30%     | 40%     |\n| SNX Liquidation Threshold    | 55%     | 60%     |\n| SUSHI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |\n| ZRX Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |\n\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 10/21 to 11/04 that were important drivers for the updated parameter recommendations.\n\n|Symbol| 11-04 Volatility| 10-21 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%) |\n|------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|\n|ENJ   |1.13420106     |1.099162375    |0.035038685      |4.707755052|\n|REN   |1.101234165    |1.530519396    |-0.429285231     |0.073368269|\n|SNX   |0.77106532     |1.070499773    |-0.299434453     |1.189819991|\n|SUSHI |0.973681039    |1.284012632    |-0.310331593     |0.641782118|\n|ZRX   |0.8480448      |1.067526026    |-0.219481226     |6.053287908|\n\n\n**Freezing KNCL**\nThe KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 11/2, 177M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://www.notion.so/7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 74M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://www.notion.so/2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There is currently 916K KNCL supply and 229k total borrowed on Aave.\n\nConsidering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ga0jHyO.png)\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/c2GahMu.png)\n\n\n## Implementation \n\nThe proposal sets the LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token. KNCL is frozen by using the `freezeReserve` method of the same `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2021-11-04/6072).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).","ipfsHash":"QmZofM3U9Eb6V7sQJ7CqJTAL7Wmo8jgvzfubNyWGupxeVP","originalHash":"0xaa5bf546d9749d02ea20efb19ac6e74c1432a1052f9cc42bbc3c39b9c7c2c5ea","id":45},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
