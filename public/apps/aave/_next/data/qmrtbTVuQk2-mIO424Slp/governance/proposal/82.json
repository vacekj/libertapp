Only one yearly review will be required.\n**This update represents a purely technical update to allow the continuation of the incentives and to stackers that have rewards left to claim to receive their incentives.**\n\n## Relevant links\n\n- AIP-19 postponing the end of safety incentives: [https://app.aave.com/governance/14-QmTYMox4aBpyQH53LwMzTuJY2z7Df7ANUSakeeeWWUoXmJ](https://app.aave.com/governance/14-QmTYMox4aBpyQH53LwMzTuJY2z7Df7ANUSakeeeWWUoXmJ)\n- Aavenomics : [https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/)\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis proposal exclusively increases the allowance of AAVE from the AAVE Ecosystem's reserve (owner) to stkAAVE and stkABPT (spenders).\nIn order to comply with the requirements of the Controller of the Reserve, there is a previous reset of allowance to 0, before the increase.\n\n**Target Contracts**\n\nAllowanceRenewalSMPayload = [https://etherscan.io/address/0x83fba23163662149b33dbc05cf1312df6dcba72b#code](\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x83fba23163662149b33dbc05cf1312df6dcba72b#code)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n","ipfsHash":"QmTGzYiWMBG5pdUL5pc5i4jTSkad366rwtXnb2bmbSNYEo","originalHash":"0x495a8adb28587f0b208aaa0fcb19686c15cd344e5d360480220b0d2f1ff86694","id":82},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
