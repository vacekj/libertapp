This is only sensible to do when ETH borrow rates are lower than stETH rewards. With the current interest modals the utilization has reached up to 19% (an all time high) and can grow further to about 24%. With the above updates it will allow utilization to go up to 70%. Yeilding good returns to users and a 3-4x increase in ETH revenue for the Aave protocol.\n\nFollow the forum post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/optimize-rate-curve-for-eth-improve-revenue-generation/7571) for more detailed description on calcualations, benefits & risks.\n\n## Specification\n\nProposed updated to ETH rates:\n\n- OPTIMAL_UTILIZATION_RATE = **70** (previously: 65)\n- EXCESS_UTILIZATION_RATE = **30** (previously: 35)\n- baseVariableBorrowRate = **0** (previously: 0)\n- variableRateSlope1 = **3** (previously: 8)\n- variableRateSlope2 = **100** (previously: 100)\n- stableRateSlope1 = **4** (previously: 10)\n- stableRateSlope2 = **100** (previously: 100)\n\n\n## Rationale\nCurrent stETH rewards are 4%. Staking rewards on ETH via Lido are still relatively high and stETH still has the capacity to accept another $4.5B of ETH. This increase in stETH supply would only reduce the rewards by 0.3%, meaning there is at least 1.5M ETH (~$4-5B USD) that could get staked. For Aave, it represents $4-5B in borrowings of ETH (more significant than any borrowing market that currently exists across any token)\n\n**Projected rates at current a 3% borrowing rate:**\n\n- Utilization: 24.5% [very low utilization leading to less revenue generation]\n- Borrowing rate: 3.02%\n- Supplying rate: 0.66% [low incentives for new lenders to come in]\n\n**Projected rates at 3% borrow rate and 70% utilization:**\n\n- Utilization: 70% [good revenue for governance]\n- Borrow rate: 3%\n- Supplying rate: 1.9% [decent for new lenders to come in or to get a discount for stable coin borrowing against ETH]\n\nSee Governance Post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/optimize-rate-curve-for-eth-improve-revenue-generation/7571) for more detailed description on calcualations, benefits & risks.\n\n## Implementation\n\n[Here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEc368D82cb2ad9fc5EfAF823B115A622b52bcD5F#code) is the new rate strategy.\n[Here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x49e4db0a4d63c73bae75747ee12ab63bbdda3207#code) is the execution payload.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n","ipfsHash":"QmU8YK9g7ELcjJx75roKGaLMSm2kg7DxTxZQjZencbVRH3","originalHash":"0x560beb8b858395e146aaaf9d242f7a4da3569311fa288eaf63648402ca929a22","id":68},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
