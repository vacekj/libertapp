It allows users to stake their MATIC tokens on the Ethereum mainnet and immediately get the representation of their share in the form of stMATIC token without maintaining staking infrastructure. Users will receive staking rewards whilst being able to utilize their stMATIC tokens in secondary pools on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon.\n\nListing stMATIC as collateral will enable depositors to borrow funds against stMATIC. In addition, a special 'MATIC correlated' eMode will be created for just stMATIC and wMATIC, a $7.5M Supply Cap will be set and borrowing disabled to manage the risk exposure with this asset listing.\n\n# Motivation\n\nListing stMATIC on the Aave v3 pool would allow Aave DAO to benefit from the first mover advantage and hopefully in time replicate the success of the stETH listing which has generated $1.38B in TVL on the Ethereum Aave v2 pool. \n\nAs with the stETH listing on Ethereum Aave v2 pool, we expect stMATIC to stimulate demand for wMATIC and other assets. With the introduction of eMode on Aave v3, we expect the recursive stMATIC and wMATIC loop to create a significant source of yield for Users. \n\n## Specification\n\nIn supporting the stMATIC asset listing, this proposal creates a pool that reflects the characteristics shown below and connects the Chainlink oracle price source to AaveOracle.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nAll the components involved in this proposal (tokens' implementations, interest rate strategy, oracle feed, proposal payload) have been tested and reviewed, including simulations on mainnet of the whole proposal lifecycle.\n\nThis proposal has been tested and peer reviewed by [Bored Ghost Developing](https://twitter.com/bgdlabs).\n\nLink to Test Cases: [Here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-v3-crosschain-stmatic-listing/blob/master/src/test/PolygonStMaticE2E.t.sol)\n\n## Implementation\n\nLlama recommends the following parameter configuration upon listing stMATIC.\n\nRisk Parameters:\n\nCollateral: Yes\nBorrowing: No\nLTV: 50%\nLiquidation Threshold: 65%\nLiquidation Bonus: 10%\nReserve Factor: 20%\nChainlink Oracle: [0x97371dF4492605486e23Da797fA68e55Fc38a13f](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x97371dF4492605486e23Da797fA68e55Fc38a13f)\n\nVariable Interest Rate Parameters:\n\nUOptimal: 45%\nR_0: 0%\nR_s1: 7%\nR_s2: 300%\n\n'MATIC correlated' eMode Parameters:\n\nLTV: 92.5%\nLiquidation Threshold: 95%\nLiquidation Bonus: 1%\n \nSupply / Borrow Caps:\n\nNewSupplyCap: $7.5m stMATIC\n\nThe governance forum proposal discussing Add stMATIC on Aave v3 Polygon pool can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-stmatic-lido/7677) and the snapshot vote can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xc8646abba01becf81ad32bf4adf48f723a31483dc4dedc773bbb6e3954c3990f). \n\nLink to Payload Implementation: [Here](https://github.com/llama-community/aave-v3-crosschain-stmatic-listing/blob/master/src/contracts/polygon/StMaticPayload.sol)\n\n**Deployed Contracts**\nProposalPayload = [0xc730008C64783a283988b0fA3b5eE6b6F997922A](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xc730008C64783a283988b0fA3b5eE6b6F997922A)\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n","ipfsHash":"QmRrpBPvmhdmpCBRLhGcUZ56e82Ad8F7syVCMJXM6kP5kS","originalHash":"0x344d3181f08b3186228b93bac0005a3a961238164b8b06cbb5f0428a9180b8a7","id":99},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
