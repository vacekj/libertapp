As needed, it also connects a price source on the AaveOracle.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nAll the components involved in this proposal (tokens' implementations, interest rate strategy, oracle feed, proposal payload) have been tested and reviewed, including simulations on mainnet of the whole proposal lifecycle.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- [ProposalPayload](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf42d0a1b03c0795021272a4793cd03dcb97581d3#code)\n- [aENS implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB2f4Fb41F01CdeF7c10F0e8aFbeB3cFA79d1686F#code)\n- [Variable Debt ENS implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2386694b2696015dB1a511AB9cD310e800F93055#code)\n- [Stable Debt ENS implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5746b5b6650dd8d9b1d9d1bbf5e7f23e9761183f#code)\n- [Interest rate strategy](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2eD1eCE1c13455Ce9299d35D3B00358529f3Dc8#code) \n- [EnsUsdToEnsEth price feed](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd4641b75015E6536E8102D98479568D05D7123Db#code)\n- LTV: 50%\n- Liquidation threshold: 60%\n- Liquidation bonus: 8%\n- Reserve Factor: 20%\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).","ipfsHash":"QmU4MH1mps19vXJzWeV555T6yhqX2sqSceaN1fkkxgFDe1","originalHash":"0x54f91e12ea75ccaf9101fa8d59bf08b9edab7a745f16ca0ac26b668e47b93952","id":63},"prerendered":true},"__N_SSG":true}
